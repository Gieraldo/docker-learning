student@pod-username-node01:~$ nusactl start do-003-4

Execute in pod-[username]-node02

Note: If there is a [username], change it to your username. If there is [X] in the IP is the attendance number.

1. Create directory /share and Create index.html.

3. Creating docker volume with driver sshfs.

docker volume create --driver vieux/sshfs -o sshcmd=student@10.7.7.20:/share  -o allow_other sshvolume


4. Test running container with the volume.

docker run -d --name=nginxtest-sshfs -p 8090:80 -v sshvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html registry.adinusa.id/btacademy/nginx:latest
